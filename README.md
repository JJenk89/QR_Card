### What I learned

This small starter project was just to get aquainted with the Frontend Mentor challenges.

I found the workflow which the site puts you in, along with the provided information, gave structure to the process and it was overall much easier than developing something from scratch.

This has given me a much better idea of how to organise my own projects in the future.

### Continued development

I will take on much more challenging projects in the coming weeks involving JavaScript and React.

### Useful resources

-   [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - A fantastic resource and great for quick refreshers on syntax!
